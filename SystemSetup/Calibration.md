### Drone Calibration  
The sensors in the drone need to be calibrated properly before flight. The three major calibrations that need to be done for the drone are level calibration, radio calibration and compass calibration. 

**1. Level calibration** : the level calibration must be done from a level surface; otherwise it gives error. The mobile app gives prompt that tells us in which direction to place the drone on the floor. The front side of the drone should be facing exactly the same direction in which the calibrating person is facing. This calibration is important so that the drone sensors can know which way is front, back, left,right, up and down. 

**2. Compass calibration** : The compass calibration is done from the mission planner because it gives a better graphical view of the number of samples taken in order to identify the compass directions. The average number of samples we took is around 800 but less number of samples could work too. After the calibration, it is good to check whether the mission planner app actually faces north when the drone faces the north direction. 

**3. Radio Calibration** :is necessary for the controller. It is mainly used to set the maximum and minimum range of motion of the sticks on the controller. The drone has four channels for controlling yaw, throttle, pitch and roll. Throttle controls the vertical up and down motion. Yaw is the left and right rotation of the drone. Pitch is forward and backward motion. Roll is left right motion of the drone. The calibration was mainly done by moving the sticks to their extreme positions. This was also done on mission planner.  

Channel 1: low = roll left, high = roll right.
Channel 2: low = pitch forward, high=pitch back.
Channel 3: low = throttle down (off), high = throttle up.
Channel 4: low = yaw left, high = yaw right.
