### 3DR solo firmware update

One of the first setup is updating the firmware in the drone and controller. We used a manual download  and update of the firmware in the drone, but it is also possible to do it from the solo link mobile app.The Solo firmware upgrades will fix bugs in the controller software and also may have additional features that didn’t exist previous versions. This needs to be done only once during intial setup unless it is necessary later. 

#### Manual update
* Click on initial setup tab
* Click on Install firmware: This gives you an image of different types of  UAVs
* It says None under the quadcopter image for mission planner  or doesn’t respond when it is clicked
* Open this [link](http://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/MissionPlanner/)
* Go to firmware tab and click on APM Copter
* Therefore, first download .px4 file from this website

#### Updating from the sololink app

The sololink app can also be used to update the firmware even though we didn’t do this for this project. The suggested steps are:

* Turn on both solo quadcopter and GCS software such as APM or Mission Planner and connect the drone
* Open the 3DR solo app
* Go to settings menu
* Select “software update”
